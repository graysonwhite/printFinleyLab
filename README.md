# Print Instructions for the Natural Resources 128 Printer (for Linux Users) 

The Natural Resources building at Michigan State has a very nice Toshiba printer located in room 128. However, sucessfully printing from a Linux machine to that printer has been particularly difficult. 

In order to print to the printer, you must first be on the network and add the printer (Toshiba E-studio 5540C). Next, you can add the necessary driver by selecting something like "add ppd file". This is the `.ppd` file that is in this repository. After you have added the file, printing should work as expected. When you go to print, you may see a warning: "There is a warning on printer: [printer name]". However, this does not appear to effect the functionality of printing.
